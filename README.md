# JustCode
just build something lab. 


To become a coder, you need to create more than a bunch of solutions to problems with a Lab(s).

You need to create something, either in a group or as an individual.

### Protocol for the Project's Phases

This JustCode project should have several phases. As you complete each phase, you need to make sure you have tests, demos, and a little documentation about the Project (and the phase you just completed).

- Decide on Project
  - One of the projs below, or your own ideas.
- Begin “back end” biz logic
  - In Java, UML and so one, Model the data the app needs to handle
  - Decide on business logic (how to manage and move data)
  - Build lots of unit tests to show the code is working
- Add Text/Console interface
  - create a simple terminal I/O (console) interface to the business logic classes.
  - use this to decide ona few Use Cases (what a user can do with/in your app)
- Implement SQL db
  - using an ORM or JPA (look it up!) start saving your obejcts to either Postgres or MySQL.
- … simmer
- Add GUI (Web/Angular/Typescript) “front end”
  - more on this later
